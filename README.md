# go-crypto-source
Options for using `crypto/rand` to build a `math/rand.Source`

## Slides
There is not much actual code here, but part of the intention for this repository is to be an educational tool, so there is a slide presentation available in `./.slides/`.

To run the slides:
```
$ go get -u golang.org/x/tools/present
$ cd $REPO_ROOT/.slides/ && present .
```
